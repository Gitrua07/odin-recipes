# odin-recipes

# Description:
This project is an assignment for *The Odin Project* Foundation's Course. I created a recipe website that holds a collection
of favourite recipes.

There are 3 important organizational elements: 
* **Index.html** - This page is the homepage. It makes all the recipes accessible in one spot.
* **Recipes folder** - This folder holds the 3 recipe pages.
* **Img folder** - This folder holds any images I used on my pages.
